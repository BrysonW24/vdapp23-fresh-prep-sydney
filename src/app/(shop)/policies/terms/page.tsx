      </p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Fresh Prep Sydney website and services, you
        agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you do not agree,
        please do not use our services.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Orders</h2>
      <p>
        All orders placed through our website are subject to availability and
        confirmation. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order at our
        discretion. Prices are displayed in Australian dollars (AUD) and are
        inclusive of GST unless otherwise stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once an order is confirmed, changes may only be made up to 48 hours
        before the scheduled delivery date. After this cut-off, orders cannot
        be modified or cancelled.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        We deliver to selected suburbs across the Greater Sydney area. Delivery
        days and available time slots are displayed at checkout based on your
        postcode. While we strive to deliver on the scheduled date, delays may
        occur due to unforeseen circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring someone is available to receive the
        delivery or that a safe, shaded location is accessible for contactless
        delivery. Fresh Prep Sydney is not liable for spoilage if meals are
        left unrefrigerated after delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription plans renew automatically on a weekly basis. You may pause
        or cancel your subscription at any time before the weekly cut-off
        (currently Wednesday 11:59 PM AEST). Cancellations take effect from the
        following delivery cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Fresh Prep Sydney shall not be
        liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
        arising from your use of our services. Our total liability for any
        claim related to a specific order is limited to the amount you paid for
        that order.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms &amp; Conditions from time to time. Any
        changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
        Continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your
        acceptance of the revised terms.
