## Key Assumptions (From Industry Research)

| Variable | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Instagram reach per post | 15–20% of followers | Social Insider 2025 |
| Instagram link CTR | 1–3% of those who see it | Quimby Digital 2025 |
| Pages per session | 1.8x | Food blog average |
| Organic search share of traffic | 50–70% (once SEO matures) | SE Ranking 2025 |
| Social share of traffic | 15–25% (early stage: higher) | SE Ranking 2025 |
| AdSense RPM (food) | $3–8 | Niche Pursuits 2025 |

## Instagram → Pageview Math (Aun's 32K)

```
32,000 followers
  × 17.5% average reach per post = ~5,600 people see the post
  × 2% click-through to blog = ~112 clicks per post

If Aun posts 4x/week with blog link CTA:
  112 clicks × 4 posts = ~448 social clicks/week
  × 4.3 weeks = ~1,926 social visits/month
  × 1.8 pages per session = ~3,467 social pageviews/month
```

But social is only part of the picture. The real game is SEO traffic compounding over time.

|-------|------------------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|--------|------------|------------|----------|-----------|

## Comparison Summary

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Recipes published (Year 1) | 96 | 144 | 144 |
| Month 12 pageviews | 25,500 | 78,000 | 137,000 |
| Month 12 revenue | $768/mo | $3,879/mo | $10,008/mo |
| Year 1 total revenue | $4,866 | $18,750 | $49,656 |
| Ad network at Month 12 | AdSense | Mediavine | Raptive |
| IG followers at Month 12 | ~38K | ~50K | ~80K+ |
| Break-even on costs ($331/yr) | Month 5 | Month 2 | Month 1 |

## The Multiplier: What Changes Everything

The single biggest variable is **which ad network you're on**. Look at Scenario 2:

```
Month 8 (AdSense):  46,000 PVs × $8 RPM  = $368/mo from ads
Month 9 (Mediavine): 53,000 PVs × $20 RPM = $1,060/mo from ads
```

**Same content. Same effort. 3x the revenue.** Just from qualifying for a better ad network.

And from Scenario 3:

```
Month 9 (Mediavine): 97,000 PVs × $28 RPM = $2,716/mo from ads
Month 10 (Raptive):  113,000 PVs × $40 RPM = $4,520/mo from ads
```

**The jump from Mediavine to Raptive is another ~1.5–2x.**

---

## Revenue Per Recipe (The Asset Value)

Each recipe is a permanent asset. Here's what a single recipe is worth over time:

| Scenario | Avg monthly PVs per recipe (Month 12) | Ad revenue per recipe/month | Annual value per recipe |
|----------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Conservative | ~266 PVs | $2.13 | $25.50 |
| Moderate | ~542 PVs | $15.17 | $182.00 |
| Aggressive | ~951 PVs | $42.80 | $513.60 |

In the aggressive scenario, **each recipe Aun publishes is worth ~$500/year in passive ad revenue**. Publish 144 recipes and that's $72K/year from ads alone — growing every year as SEO compounds.

---

## Year 2 Projection (Moderate Scenario)

If Aun maintains the moderate scenario pace into Year 2:

| Metric | Month 12 | Month 18 | Month 24 |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Total recipes | 144 | 216 | 288 |
| Monthly pageviews | 78,000 | 140,000 | 220,000 |
| Ad network | Mediavine | Raptive | Raptive |
| Ad RPM | $28 | $42 | $45 |
| Ad revenue | $2,184 | $5,880 | $9,900 |
| Affiliates | $195 | $350 | $550 |
| Sponsors | $1,500 | $3,000 | $4,000 |
| **Monthly total** | **$3,879** | **$9,230** | **$14,450** |

**Year 2 total (moderate): ~$120,000–$140,000**

---

## Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Impact | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Publishing consistency (2–3 recipes/week) | Without content there's nothing to monetise | #1 |
| SEO from day one (WPRM schema + Yoast) | Organic search is 50–70% of mature traffic | #2 |
| Graduating ad networks (AdSense → Mediavine → Raptive) | 3–7x revenue jump at each tier | #3 |
| TikTok launch | Multiplies social traffic 3–5x | #4 |
| Long-form content (2,000+ words) | More scroll = more ad impressions per visit | #5 |
| Seasonal content timing | Q4 RPMs are 30–50% higher | #6 |

---

## Biggest Risk: Google AI Overviews

The food/recipe niche has seen a **7.25 percentage point increase** in AI Overview presence since March 2025. This means Google is increasingly answering recipe queries directly in search results, reducing clicks to food blogs.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Focus on complex meal prep content (harder for AI to summarise vs. simple recipes)
- Build direct traffic through email newsletter and social followers
- Diversify beyond Google: TikTok, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube
- Create content with strong personal voice and photography that can't be replicated by AI
- Target long-tail keywords AI Overviews don't cover well

---

## Bottom Line for Aun

With 32K Instagram followers, if she starts publishing consistently:

- **Worst case (conservative):** ~$768/mo by month 12. Covers costs, builds a library of recipe assets
- **Realistic case (moderate):** ~$3,879/mo by month 12. Real passive income. $14K+/mo by month 24
- **Best case (aggressive):** ~$10,008/mo by month 12. Full income replacement level

**The recipe blog costs $331/year to run and has zero downside risk.** Even the conservative scenario pays for itself by month 5. Every recipe published is a permanent income-generating asset.
