---

## Starting Position

- Aun has **32K Instagram followers** (warm audience, real engagement)
- Fresh Prep Sydney has an existing meal prep customer base
- Blog system is built and ready to publish
- Recipe JSON-LD structured data is wired for Google rich snippets
- No existing blog content or search authority yet

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

### Content Production

**Target: 3 posts per week = 12-13 posts per month**

This is the single most important factor. Google needs volume to understand what your site is about and start ranking you. Butterhand publishes consistently and has hundreds of posts.

**Content types to rotate:**

1. **Hero recipes** (1/week) — Full butterhand-style posts, 2,000-3,000 words. These are the money posts. Meal prep recipes that solve a specific problem: "High Protein Chicken Meal Prep Under $5 Per Serve", "5-Day Work Lunch Prep in 90 Minutes".

2. **Quick recipes** (1/week) — Shorter 800-1,200 word posts. Simple recipes that still have full structured data. "15-Minute Thai Basil Chicken", "3-Ingredient Overnight Oats". These build your content library fast.

3. **Guides & listicles** (1/week) — Informational content that captures search traffic. "Best Meal Prep Containers in Australia 2025", "How Long Does Meal Prep Last in the Fridge?", "12 Freezer-Friendly Meals That Actually Taste Good". These rank faster than recipe posts and bring in top-of-funnel traffic.

### Keyword Strategy

**Go after low-competition, high-intent keywords first.** Don't try to rank for "chicken recipe" (billions of results). Target:

- **Long-tail recipe keywords**: "high protein meal prep recipes Australia", "budget meal prep sydney", "freezer meal prep for beginners"
- **Question-based keywords**: "how long does meal prep last", "can you freeze rice for meal prep", "best containers for meal prep"
- **Local + niche**: "meal prep delivery sydney", "healthy lunch ideas sydney", "aussie meal prep recipes"
- **Seasonal**: "summer meal prep ideas", "christmas meal prep australia", "back to school lunch prep"

**Tools for keyword research:**
- Google Search Console (free, install immediately)
- Ubersuggest (free tier)
- AnswerThePublic (free tier for question-based keywords)
- Google's "People Also Ask" boxes (free, just search and note them)
- Ahrefs or SEMrush (paid, but free trials exist)

### SEO Foundations

1. **Install Google Search Console** — submit sitemap, monitor impressions/clicks
2. **Install Google Analytics 4** — track pageviews, user behaviour, traffic sources
3. **Verify structured data** — use Google Rich Results Test on every recipe post
4. **Internal linking** — every new post should link to 2-3 other posts on the site
5. **Site speed** — Next.js already gives you good Core Web Vitals, but optimise images (use next/image, WebP format, lazy loading)
6. **XML sitemap** — ensure it auto-updates with new posts

### Instagram-to-Blog Pipeline

This is Aun's superpower. The 32K followers are the kickstart that most food bloggers don't have.

**Strategy:**

1. **Every blog post gets an Instagram post** — cook the recipe, shoot it, post a carousel or reel with "Full recipe on the blog, link in bio"
2. **Instagram Stories** — "New recipe up! Swipe up" (or link sticker). Do this the day the post goes live AND 2-3 days later
3. **Reels** — 30-60 second cooking clips with text overlay. These get algorithmic reach beyond your followers. End with "Full recipe at freshprepsydney.com.au"
4. **Link in bio** — Use a Linktree-style page or direct link to `/blog` that shows latest recipes
5. **Story highlights** — Create a "Recipes" highlight that links to the blog

**Expected traffic from Instagram:** With 32K followers, expect 500-2,000 clicks per post to the blog in the first few months. That's 2,000-8,000 monthly visits just from Instagram if posting 4x/month.

---

## Phase 2: Growth (Months 3-6)

### Content Acceleration

By now you should have 30-40 posts live. Google is starting to understand your site.

**Priorities:**

1. **Double down on what's working** — Check Search Console for which posts are getting impressions. Create more content in those topic clusters.
2. **Update underperforming posts** — If a post is getting impressions but low clicks, rewrite the title and meta description to be more compelling.
3. **Build topic clusters** — Group related content:
   - Cluster: "Chicken Meal Prep" → 5-8 posts about different chicken meal prep recipes, all linking to each other and to a pillar post "Ultimate Guide to Chicken Meal Prep"
   - Cluster: "Budget Meal Prep" → posts about cheap recipes, budget shopping lists, cost breakdowns
   - Cluster: "Freezer Meals" → what freezes well, how to freeze, best freezer meals

### Pinterest Strategy

Pinterest is the #2 traffic source for food blogs after Google. It's a visual search engine, not a social network.

**Setup:**

1. Create a Pinterest Business account
2. Claim your website (adds your logo to pins from your site)
3. Enable Rich Pins (pulls recipe data automatically)
4. Create boards: "Meal Prep Recipes", "Healthy Lunch Ideas", "Budget Meals", "Freezer Meals", "High Protein Recipes"

**Posting cadence:**

- Pin every blog post (create 2-3 different pin images per post)
- Pin daily (5-10 pins/day mixing your content with repins)
- Use Tailwind or Pinterest's native scheduler
- Pin images should be vertical (1000x1500px), have text overlay with the recipe title, and look appetising

**Expected traffic from Pinterest:** Pinterest is slow to build (3-6 month ramp) but compounds. By month 6, expect 3,000-10,000 monthly visits from Pinterest.

### Email List Building

Start collecting emails from day 1. Email subscribers are the most valuable audience — you control the relationship, no algorithm changes can take it away.

**Lead magnets:**

- "Free 5-Day Meal Prep Plan" (PDF download in exchange for email)
- "Weekly Meal Prep Shopping List" template
- "10 Freezer Meals Under $50" mini guide

**Email strategy:**

- Send weekly newsletter with latest recipe + a meal prep tip
- Use ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or Brevo (all have free tiers)
- Every email drives traffic back to the blog (1 click = 1 pageview)
- Even 500 email subscribers sending 1 click/week = 2,000 monthly pageviews

### YouTube Shorts / TikTok

Short-form video is the fastest way to reach new audiences in 2025-2026.

- Repurpose Instagram Reels to YouTube Shorts and TikTok
- Same 30-60 second cooking clips
- YouTube Shorts can drive traffic via pinned comments linking to the full recipe
- TikTok bio link to the blog
- This is about reach, not direct traffic — builds brand awareness so people Google "fresh prep sydney [recipe name]"

---

## Phase 3: Authority Building (Months 6-9)

By now you should have 60-80 posts and be getting 15,000-30,000 monthly pageviews.

### Apply to Mediavine

**Requirements:**

- 50,000 sessions in the last 30 days
- Good standing with Google AdSense
- Original, long-form content
- Good site speed and user experience

**When you hit 50K sessions, apply immediately.** Approval takes 2-4 weeks. Mediavine RPMs are 3-5x higher than AdSense.

### Google Discover

Google Discover is the feed on Android phones and the Google app. It can send massive traffic spikes (10,000+ visits in a day) to food content.

**How to get into Discover:**

- High-quality, original hero images (not stock photos — Aun's actual food photos)
- Compelling titles that create curiosity
- Posts that are timely or seasonal
- Good E-E-A-T signals (author bio, about page, social proof)
- AMP or fast page loads (Next.js handles this)

### Guest Posting & Backlinks

Backlinks (other sites linking to yours) are still the strongest Google ranking factor.

**Strategies:**

- Write guest posts for Australian food/lifestyle blogs
- Get featured in "best meal prep" roundup posts
- Partner with other Sydney food creators for recipe swaps
- Submit to recipe aggregator sites
- Reach out to local Sydney media for features (newspapers, lifestyle magazines)
- HARO (Help A Reporter Out) — respond to journalist queries about meal prep, healthy eating, food budgeting

### Content Refresh Cycle

Go back to your earliest posts and update them:

- Add more detail, more sections, more words
- Update photos
- Add new internal links to newer posts
- Refresh the publish date (Google favours fresh content)
- This alone can double traffic to older posts

---

## Phase 4: Scale to Raptive (Months 9-12+)

### Apply to Raptive

**Requirements:**

- 100,000+ pageviews per month
- Primarily English content
- Original content (no scraped/AI-only content)
- Site must be in good standing

**Raptive RPMs for food content: $35-55.** At 100K pageviews, that's $3,500-$5,500/month.

### Content at Scale

At this stage, you need to maintain 3-4 posts per week while also:

- Updating older content quarterly
- Building out comprehensive pillar pages
- Creating seasonal content calendars (plan 3 months ahead)
- A/B testing titles and meta descriptions for CTR improvement

### Diversify Traffic Sources

Don't rely on any single source. Healthy distribution:

- 50-60% Google Search (organic)
- 15-20% Pinterest
- 10-15% Instagram/Social
- 5-10% Email
- 5-10% Direct/Other

### Secondary Revenue Streams (Layer on Top of Ads)

Once traffic is flowing, add:

1. **Affiliate links** — meal prep containers, kitchen tools, ingredients (Amazon Associates AU, Commission Factory)
2. **Digital products** — premium meal prep plans, e-books, printable shopping lists
3. **Sponsored posts** — brands pay $500-2,000 per post once you have traffic
4. **Cross-sell to meal prep business** — the blog drives awareness, the business delivers meals

## Content Calendar Template

### Weekly Publishing Schedule

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Monday | Hero recipe (2,000+ words) | "5-Day High Protein Meal Prep: Chicken, Rice & Greens" |
| Wednesday | Quick recipe (800-1,200 words) | "15-Minute Teriyaki Salmon Bowl" |
| Friday | Guide/Listicle (1,500+ words) | "How to Start Meal Prepping: Complete Beginner's Guide" |

### Monthly Content Mix

- 4 hero recipes (money posts, full butterhand structure)
- 4 quick recipes (build library volume)
- 4 guides/listicles (capture informational search traffic)
- 1 seasonal/trending post (ride search trends)

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Weekly

- Total pageviews (Google Analytics)
- New posts published (target: 3/week)
- Instagram clicks to blog (Instagram Insights)

### Monthly

- Google Search Console: total impressions, total clicks, average CTR, average position
- Traffic by source (Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Direct, Email)
- Top 10 posts by pageviews
- Email list size
- Pinterest impressions and outbound clicks

### Quarterly

- Compare pageview growth month-over-month
- Review keyword rankings — are you moving up?
- Content audit — which posts need updating?
- Revenue per thousand pageviews (RPM)
- Progress toward next ad network threshold

## The 10 Things That Actually Matter

1. **Publish consistently.** 3 posts/week minimum. Nothing else matters if there's no content.
2. **Write for search intent.** Answer the question someone typed into Google. Don't write diary entries.
3. **Use the Instagram audience.** Every post gets promoted to the 32K followers. This is your unfair advantage.
4. **Structured data on every recipe.** JSON-LD is already built. This gets you into Google recipe cards.
5. **Internal linking.** Every post links to 2-3 other posts. This spreads authority across the site.
6. **Optimise images.** Compress, use WebP, add alt text. Images are 60% of food blog traffic from Google Images and Discover.
7. **Build email list from day 1.** Even a small list (500 subscribers) drives consistent traffic.
8. **Pinterest is non-negotiable.** It's free traffic that compounds. Set it up in month 1.
9. **Don't chase viral.** Chase consistent. 100 posts getting 1,000 views each = 100K pageviews.
10. **Patience.** Google takes 3-6 months to start ranking new sites. The first 3 months will feel slow. That's normal.

| 4 | 10,000 - 20,000 | $30 - $160 | Topic clusters forming, Pinterest traffic growing |
| 5 | 15,000 - 30,000 | $45 - $240 | Google Discover potential, content refresh cycle begins |
| 6 | 20,000 - 40,000 | $60 - $320 | Approaching Mediavine threshold |
| 7-8 | 30,000 - 60,000 | $450 - $2,100* | Apply to Mediavine at 50K sessions |
| 9-10 | 50,000 - 80,000 | $750 - $2,800 | Mediavine RPMs kicking in, authority building |
| 11-12 | 70,000 - 120,000 | $1,050 - $6,600** | Approaching/hitting Raptive threshold |

\* Revenue jumps when switching from AdSense ($3-8 RPM) to Mediavine ($15-35 RPM)
\** Revenue jumps again with Raptive ($35-55 RPM)

**Conservative Year 1 total: ~$4,500 - $5,000**
**Moderate Year 1 total: ~$12,000 - $18,000**
**Aggressive Year 1 total: ~$25,000 - $50,000**

## What Makes or Breaks This

### Success factors
- Aun's food photography and cooking skills (already proven on Instagram)
- Existing 32K audience for initial traffic
- Technical SEO already handled (JSON-LD, fast site, proper metadata)
- Meal prep niche is evergreen and high-RPM

### Risk factors
- **Publishing consistency** — if Aun stops posting for 2 weeks, growth stalls. This is the #1 killer.
- **Content quality** — thin 300-word posts won't rank. Need the full butterhand treatment on hero posts.
- **Patience** — months 1-3 will feel like nothing is happening. This is normal. Don't quit.
- **AI content penalties** — Google penalises pure AI-generated content. Use AI for drafts/outlines, but Aun's voice, photos, and experience must be the core.
