## Revenue Streams

### 1. Display Ads (Primary Passive Income)

- **Ad network:** Raptive (formerly AdThrive) — premium tier, requires 100K+ monthly pageviews to qualify
- **Typical RPM:** $15–30+ per 1,000 pageviews for food/recipe content
- **Why it works:** Every recipe page is a monetised asset. Old content keeps earning indefinitely.
- **Estimated revenue:** $3,000–8,000/mo at scale (200K–500K monthly pageviews)

### 2. Brand Sponsorships (Active Income)

- Brands pay to be featured in recipes (e.g. specific cracker brands shown prominently in photos/ingredients)
- Contact page serves as a brand inquiry funnel
- Dedicated business email for partnership enquiries
- **Estimated per deal:** $2,000–10,000+ depending on deliverables and follower count

### 3. Social Media Platform Payouts (Semi-Passive)

- TikTok Creator Fund / Creativity Program
- YouTube ad revenue (if channel is monetised)
- Instagram bonuses and Reels payouts
- **Estimated:** $500–3,000/mo at 1M+ combined followers

### 4. SEO Compounding (The Flywheel)

- Structured recipe data (schema markup) makes recipes appear in Google rich snippets
- Long-tail keywords like "fennel apple baked dip recipe" have low competition and steady volume
- Content posted years ago still generates traffic every season (soup recipes spike in winter, BBQ in summer)
- This is what makes the income truly *passive* over time

## Content Strategy

### Short-Form Video (Traffic Driver)

- 30–60 second ASMR-style cooking videos on TikTok and Instagram Reels
- High production food photography (close-up shots, natural lighting)
- Every video includes CTA: "recipe in my bio" or "visit butterhand.com"
- Goal: viral reach to drive traffic to the blog

### Long-Form Blog Posts (Revenue Generator)

- Detailed recipe pages with:
  - Hero food photography
  - Component breakdowns explaining each ingredient's role
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Storage and reheating guides
  - Make-ahead tips
  - Full WPRM recipe card at the bottom (structured data for Google)
- SEO-optimised titles and headers
- Extensive content length (1,500–3,000+ words) which increases ad impressions per page

### Content Formula Per Recipe

```
1. Shoot the recipe (photo + video)
2. Post short-form video to TikTok/IG/YouTube Shorts
3. Write detailed blog post on WordPress
4. WPRM recipe card with structured schema
5. Social drives initial spike, SEO drives long-tail traffic
6. Display ads earn on every visit, forever
```

## What Makes This Model Work

### Evergreen Content
Recipes don't expire. A soup recipe from 2022 still gets traffic every winter. Each post is a permanent asset.

### Dual Traffic Sources
- **Social media** gives traffic spikes (viral moments)
- **Google SEO** gives steady baseline traffic (compounding over time)
- Together they create resilience — you're not dependent on any single algorithm

### Low Overhead
- No inventory, no shipping, no fulfillment
- No employees needed (solo creator model)
- Hosting + domain is ~$200/year
- The product is content, which costs time but not money

### The Blog Is the Bank
Social media builds the audience, but the **website** is where the money is made. This is critical — creators who only post on social platforms miss the ad revenue entirely.

## Applying This to Fresh Prep Sydney

### Direct Parallels
- Food/recipe content in Sydney market
- Can leverage the same WordPress + WPRM + Raptive stack
- Short-form video content (TikTok/IG Reels) to drive blog traffic
- Local SEO angle: "best meal prep recipes Sydney", "healthy lunch ideas Australia"

### Additional Opportunities
- **Meal prep niche** is more targeted than general recipes — potentially higher RPM due to health/fitness ad demand
- **Local angle** reduces competition in search results vs. global recipe blogs
- **Subscription model** could layer on top: weekly meal prep plans via email (paid newsletter)
- **Affiliate links** for kitchen equipment, meal prep containers, grocery delivery services (missing from butterhand's model — opportunity to add)

### Recommended Tech Stack for Fresh Prep Sydney

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| CMS | WordPress (already proven for recipe SEO) or Next.js if building custom |
| Recipe schema | WP Recipe Maker or custom JSON-LD structured data |
| Ad network | Start with Google AdSense, graduate to Mediavine (50K views) then Raptive (100K views) |
| Email | ConvertKit or Beehiiv for newsletter/meal plan subscriptions |
| Affiliates | Amazon Associates, iHerb, local grocery delivery partners |
| Hosting | Vercel (if Next.js) or WP Engine / Cloudways (if WordPress) |
